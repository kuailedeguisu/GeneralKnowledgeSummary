1.StringBuffer
public final class StringBuffer
extends Object
implements Serializable, Comparable<StringBuffer>, CharSequence
A thread-safe, mutable sequence of characters. A string buffer is like a String, but can be modified. 
At any point in time it contains some particular sequence of characters, but the length and content of the sequence 
can be changed through certain method calls.
String buffers are safe for use by multiple threads. The methods are synchronized where necessary 
so that all the operations on any particular instance behave as if they occur in some serial order 
that is consistent with the order of the method calls made by each of the individual threads involved.

The principal operations on a StringBuffer are the append and insert methods, which are overloaded 
so as to accept data of any type. Each effectively converts a given datum to a string and then 
appends or inserts the characters of that string to the string buffer. The append method always 
adds these characters at the end of the buffer; the insert method adds the characters at a specified point.
-----------------------------------------------------------
thread-safe: sync(data can't be operated at the same time, safe)
thread-unsafe:not sync(efficiently)
You only have safety or efficience.We only can consider one item according to the situation.
bank:               safe
news and internet:  efficience
---------------------------------------------------------
StringBuffer: thread-safe, mutable sequene
The difference between StringBuffer and String:
StringBuffer: length and content of it are changed, String appending will not waste a lot of memory
String: length and content of it are not changed, String appending will waste a lot of memory
----------------------
StringBuffer constructor methods:
StringBuffer()	
Constructs a string buffer with no characters in it and an initial capacity of 16 characters.
StringBuffer​(int capacity)	
Constructs a string buffer with no characters in it and the specified initial capacity.
StringBuffer​(CharSequence seq)	
Constructs a string buffer that contains the same characters as the specified CharSequence.
StringBuffer​(String str)	
Constructs a string buffer initialized to the contents of the specified string.

StringBuffer member methods:
capacity: theorical value
public int capacity()
Returns the current capacity. The capacity is the amount of storage available for newly inserted characters, beyond which an allocation will occur.
Returns:
the current capacity

length: actural value
int length()
Returns the length of this character sequence. The length is the number of 16-bit chars in the sequence.
Returns:
the number of chars in this sequence
