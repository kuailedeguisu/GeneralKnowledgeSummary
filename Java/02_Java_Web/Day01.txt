Single column:
Collection: Single column collection root interface
----| List: ordered, repeated
  --------| ArrayList: based on Object instance array, find fast(memory address is continuous), add and delete slow(copy all)
  --------| Vector: based on Object instance array, but thread-safe
  --------| LinkedList: based on linked list, find slow, add and delete fast
----| Set: unordered, unrepeated
  --------| HashSet: based on hash table, store and get fast
              hashCode() and equals()
              When adding elements into HashSet, call hashCode() at first to get the hash code value,
              then compute the location of elements according to hash code value;
              If the location computed has not existed any elements, add it into hash table directly
              If the location computed has existed one element, call equals() to compare the new element and the element on the location
                If equals() return true, it is considered repeated element, and not add it into hash table
                If equals() return false, add it into hash table directly
               
              default hashCode() means the address of instance
              default equals() means two instances has the same address
